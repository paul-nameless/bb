# bb

Bitbucket's command line tool

> It's like `gh` ([GitHub's CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli)) but for BitBucket

This tools is very basic but it does all what I need at the moment (though I am happy to accept PRs)

## Installation

```sh
pip3 install bb-cli
```

## Auth

At the moment the only way it works is by `App passwords` auth: [https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/)

> For this you need to have 2FA enabled

At first launch, `bb` will ask for user and password that you generated at bitbucket and write to `~/.config/bb/conf.py`. That's plain python file and you can use it to store information securely:

```python
import os

pswd = os.popen("pass show ep/bb-cli | head -n 1").read().strip()
user = os.popen("pass show ep/bb-cli | grep username").read().strip().split(" ")[-1]

AUTH = (user, pswd)
```

## Usage

```sh
> bb pr --help
Usage: main.py pr [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
